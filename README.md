# Go-Many-Ways

## Description

A small project to play with writing a tiny project in many different ways, all in a containerized
Golang environment. 
The docker settings are working well but are still a work in progress and can be
improved on.

It is based on a video series found on Youtube, but with improvements.

# Challenges and extra features

*   Made without Go and Golang installed on the host.
*   Finish the missing functions and tests
*   Upgrade the previously tried Go CI processes
*   Realize wasn't easy to get going, it required an install script that I found
    amongst the issues for the repo. The link is in the resources.
